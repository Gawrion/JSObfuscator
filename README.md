## Features
This extension will obfuscate and minify your JavaScript code to make it more secure.

## Note : 
If you don't set the setting to change the file extension your origional files will be overwritten. In that case once the code gets obfuscated you cannot revert it to it's origional state. For best use, use this before deployment of your code.

#

## Usages
Press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` and search for `"JSObfuscator : Obfuscate Current Workspace"` to obfuscate your workspace recursively or `"JSObfuscator : Obfuscate Current File"` to obfuscate the current file.

#

## âš  Important
##### Only obfuscate code that belongs to you. 

It is not recommended to obfuscate vendor scripts and polyfills, since the obfuscated code is 15-80% slower (depending on options) and the files are significantly larger.

## Dependencies
